Unit tests:

    Happy path:
        Expect [3, 2, 1] and, [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1]  to be [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
        Expect [3, 2, 1] and, [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1] the result to be only odds numbers
        Expect  any string in the array to be raise value error
        Expect to identify zero in the arrays
        Expect the two array to be displayed in ascending order

    Unhappy path:
        When the parameters are [3, 2, 1] and, [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1] and the function don’t return any value
        Adding two array and the result is all the numbers in both array e.g. [3, 2, 1, 9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1] 
        Concatenating two arrays with numbers and strings does not raise any error. E.g [3, “h”, 1] and, [9, 1, 1, “t”, 4, 15, -1] 
        Don't recognize negative numbers
        Don't work with decimal numbers

	
Functional tests:

1. Let the users to go to the shopping cart to see what items are in the cart
2. Give the users a button for checkout.
3. The user should see the description of the items and the amount due.
4. When the user clicks on the checkout button, the page should handle he/she a page with the option to sign in or register or pay using credit card or apple pay.
